/**
 * Shared generation adapter vocabulary.
 *
 * Runtime authority for the browser provider surfaces and their current raw-text
 * streams: {@link ../../web/provider/openai-compatible.js}. Current consumers and
 * title extraction are {@link ../../web/transport/direct-host.js},
 * {@link ../../web/provider/title-sentinel.js}, and {@link ../../web/app.js}.
 * The MCP path is normalized by
 * {@link ../../node/transport/generation-ingress.js} before entering the same
 * `Run`; it has no browser-style `Provider` and receives partial/final
 * tool calls carrying `content`, `partial`, and `title` instead.
 *
 * Browser brains emit this vocabulary: branch adapters contain sentinel
 * parsing and authoring adapters emit text events only. The MCP host remains a
 * separate wire ingress with its own persistence policy.
 * Transport-level run tagging uses `ProgressRun` from {@link ./engine.js}; it
 * is intentionally not redeclared here.
 * `Run` runtime behavior is authoritative in
 * {@link ../hole/run.js}; `DocEvent` output shapes remain authoritative
 * in {@link ../hole/reduce.js} and are described by {@link ./engine.js}.
